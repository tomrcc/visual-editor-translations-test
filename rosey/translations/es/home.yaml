        A starting point for **developers looking to build a multilingual
        website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
        [Rosey](https://rosey.app/), using
        [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop)'s component-based
        approach to building and editing sites in CloudCannon**. After a
        developer has set up the site, CloudCannon provides a user interface for
        non-technical editors to maintain the site's content and enter
        translations. Create your own copy, and start creating your own
        components to use in the CloudCannon CMS.
